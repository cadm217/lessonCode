## ```.gitignore```
Ok, let's get our hands dirty with a ```.gitignore``` file to see how we can have ```git``` stop paying attention to particular files. 
We'll start at the terminal (gitbash on windows, regular terminal on Mac OSx). From in there, fire up your plotting script using your text editor:



in your plotting script write code to produce a pdf file:
pdf(file = “coolplot.pdf”)
hist(mtcars$disp)
dev.off()
Run the R code: R CMD BATCH --vanilla myPlot.R  
Type git status & type ls
Make a .gitignore file (use the touch command)
Add *.pdf to the contents of the .gitignore file
Use git add & git commit on the .gitignore file
Run ls 
(you should see the pdf listed)
Run git ls-files 
(you should not see the pdf listed)
